The goal of this project is to reverse engineer and document the firmware from the
Tandy PDD, and PDD2 floppy disk drives (cira 1984). These drives were used with the 
Tandy Model 100, 102, and 200 portable computers, and also used with the Brother
automatic knitting machines.

PDD1.ASM is the decompiled assembly source for the PDD1 that is slowly (very slowly) being documented.
PDD1.dcDisASM is the commenting and disassembler directive file that adds the documentation to the ASM file.

PDD1.LST is the decompiled assembly from DASMx 1.40

PDD2.ASM is the decompiled assembly source for the PDD2 that is slowly being documented.
PDD2_Misc.inc is misc comments and cleanup code taken out of the dcDisASM file to clean things up.
PDD2_Tables.inc contains the data tables, comments and cleanup code taken out of the dcDisASM file to clean things up.
PDD2.dcDisASM is the commenting and disassembler directive file that adds the documentation to the ASM file.

6301.inc is the CPU characteristic file for the Hitachi 6301 the dcDisASM uses.

ROM_DUMPER/PDD1_Dump.INFO, the readme for getting the PDD1 firmware to dump.
