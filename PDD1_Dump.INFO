The processor on the PDD 1 and 2 is a Hitachi 6301, which is compatible with the Motorola 6800 with a few opcodes added.
The firmware resides in ROM on the chip between addresses 0xF000 and 0xFFFF, and is not easily read. Fortunately the firmware on the PDD allows the user to send Motorola S-REC files to it set the program counter to address 0x8515.

So the idea is to create a very small routine that will read the ROM contents and push it out the SCI port (RS-232).

The PDD documentation tells the user to enter the following BASIC code into their Tandy 100, 102, or 200 in order to bootstrap the drive and load the disk driver software off of a floppy disk into the Tandy computer.

10 OPEN "COM:88N1DNN" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
20 PRINT #1, "S10985157C00AD7EF08B3AS901FE"
30 LOAD "COM:88N1ENN", R
Looking closely at the print statement you can see 2 S records.
1) S10985157C00AD7EF08B3A
2) S901FE

Line 1 is:

S1 09 8515 7C 00 AD 7E F0 8B 3A 

which translated to:
starting at address 0x8515 add the following code:

8515 INC  $00AD
8518 JMP  F08B

So it turns out that we can put code into RAM and have it get executed by the processor.
See PDD1_Dump.ASM for the dumping program written in assembly.
The compiled S-REC is PDD1_Dump.SREC.

To post the ROM yourself do the following on a PC:

1) Switch your PDD to 9600 BUAD, the switches on the bottom need to be set to ON.
2) Connect your PDD to a PC and connect with Hyper Terminal or another terminal program.
3) Settings are 9600-8-n-1, no flow control. Set the line delay and character delay to 20mS, otherwise we're pushing data to the PDD CPU too fast and will get a blinking light.
4) Paste each line of the S-REC into the terminal program, but do not include the CR/LF (i.e. only highlight the text).
5) If the Low Battery light starts blinking, start over because something bad happened (like accidently included a CR/LF).
6) When the last line is pasted "S901FE", this triggers the program running in the ROM to jump to address 0x8515 and execute the program. The ROM will be streamed back to you.
